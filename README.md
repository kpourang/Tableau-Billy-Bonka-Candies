<p>The CEO of Billy Bonka Candies has specifically requested your assistance on building visualisations to assist with analysis of key performance indicators (KPIâ€™s) on their monthly sales figures. They have acquired a number of new chocolate factories since 2014, and require  an analysis for the period 2014 to 2017. </p>
<p></p>
<p>You are asked you to create the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Month by month sales figures (using area chart) while calculating a 6-monthly running average of sales (line chart) and displaying it together with the monthly sales figures. Show the minimum and maximum value for the 6-monthly average, and include a trend line to indicate whether there is a general increase/decrease in the sales figure. </li>
<p></p>
<li>An interactive line chart whereby the user is able to select a specific calendar month, and the chart showing the monthly sales figures relative to the selected month. Chart to have each year indicated separately. Ensure to highlight the month which has been selected as well as include the month name into the chart title. </li>
<p></p>
<li>Create an animated Lollipop chart which shows the total quarterly sales by year which loops through year by year. Allow the user to select a specific quarter to see the history over the four year period. </li>
<p></p>
<li>Still using a lollipop chart, show the percentage change in sales figure, quarter by quarter. Use appropriate colours and sizing in graph.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Similar to the above, create a visualisation (using bar chart) comparing each quarter over the four years highlighting increase/decrease in sales for the specific quarter. </li>
</ol>
<p>An urgent last minute request from Mr. Bonka himself: </p>

<p>Analyse the speed of uptake between three different competitions launched, using the file provided. The competitions launched (and completed) at different times and interval over the last couple of years. A chart is required to compare the running total number of entrants per competition per week. </p>
